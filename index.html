        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Ahad, a passionate and dedicated computer science student from FAST-NUCES. Over the course of my academic journey, I've had the opportunity to work on diverse projects that have enriched my skills in software development and problem-solving.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of my notable projects is Swyftbags, where I led the development of an innovative inter-city item transportation platform using React Native. I also delved into game development with the creation of a dynamic Rock-Paper-Scissors game in JavaScript, showcasing my proficiency in both front-end and logic implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
            My experience extends to systems development as well, as demonstrated by my work on a University Management System using PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS. Additionally, I explored the realm of Digital Image Processing with a C++ application, emphasizing parallel processing with OpenMP.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond coding, I am a continuous learner, always seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Feel free to explore my projects, and if you have any questions or opportunities, I'd love to connect!
